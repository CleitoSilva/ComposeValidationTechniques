# ComposeValidationTechniques

Added field validation to ensure that the input meets specific criteria, such as minimum age requirement (18+).
- Technique 1: Utilized state and remember to manage state and validation for user input.
- Technique 2: Used derivedStateOf to optimize validation logic based on other states.

Examples:
1. ValidationExample() - Validates user input directly by checking if input is not empty and above 18.
2. DerivedStateExample() - Uses derivedStateOf to optimize state recalculation for the age validation field.
